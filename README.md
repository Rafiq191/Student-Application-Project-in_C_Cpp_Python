# Student-Application-Project-in_C_Cpp_Python
A program to collect student marks, and compute sum, average, max, and min marks. Efficiently gather user input, perform calculations, and display results. Showcase your coding prowess in data handling, calculations, and precise output.

Create a program that obtains a list of student marks from the user. Once the list is obtained, you should calculate and output the sum, average, maximum, and minimum marks. Remember to structure your code to efficiently gather user inputs, perform necessary mathematical computations, and then display the computed values appropriately. Your solution should showcase your ability to work with data structures, perform calculations, and present results accurately.

1. Get student marks from the user using a list.
2. Calculate the sum, average, maximum, and minimum marks.
3. Print the sum, average, maximum, and minimum marks.
